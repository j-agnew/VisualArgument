Although it's not perfect, I'm quite happy with the state of this band poster right now. Looking at it from a visual argument perspective, the goal is to persuade the viewer to attend the show. At first, I was going to play off of shock factor, but decided to take a less intense approach. I tried to convey the interesting parts of the band through the visuals, especially leaning on the religious imagery. The tattered, distressed look on the different images comes off - at least I hope - very appealing to the garage-rock/punk scene, who is the ideal audience. However, I feel the images come off more polished than the usual scratchy illustration, which hopefully provides a sense of professionalism (makes it seem like we actually know what we're doing). Also, the text elements are very direct, clearing providing all necessary information to the potential attendee with ease. I think after some more touch-ups, I may have something very special on my hands.
